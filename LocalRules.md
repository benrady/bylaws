The Rules of the United States Golf Association govern play. Complete text of Rules and Appendix I may be found in the [Rules of Golf, effective January 2019](https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules/rules-2019/rules-of-golf/rules-and-interpretations.html#!ruletype=pe&section=rule&rulenum=1).

Unless otherwise noted in the Rules of Golf, the penalty for breach of a Local Rule or Condition is two strokes (or loss of hole in match play).

### OUT OF BOUNDS 
Defined by inside points, at ground level, of white stakes orboundary fence posts or by a white painted line.  Rule 27-1b

### WATER AND LATERAL WATER HAZARD STAKES AND LINES 
When a water hazard or lateral water hazard is defined on only oneside, it is deemed to extend to infinity. When a water hazard or alateral water hazard is bounded by out of bounds, the hazard marginextends to and coincides with the out of bounds line.

### GROUND UNDER REPAIR 

Defined by white lines. French drains are deemed to be ground under repair. Rule 25-1

Ground under repair may include areas of unusual damage, including areas where carts or other traffic has combined with wet conditions to affect materially the ground surface, but only when so declared by an authorized member of the Committee. When immediately adjacent to an obstruction, such area is part of the obstruction.

### WHITE LINED AREAS TYING INTO ARTIFICIALLY SURFACED ROADS AND PATHS 

Have the same status as roads and paths, that of obstructions.

### WOOD CHIPS AND MULCH 

Are loose impediments, unless otherwise provided for in Notice to Competitors/Players.

### INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE COURSE 

Include cables, rods, wires or wrappings when closely attached to trees, unless otherwise provided for in the Notice to Competitors/Players.

### STAKES AND SUPPORT WIRE FOR TREES 

Are immovable obstructions governed by Rule 24-2.

### WRONG SCORE FOR HOLE IN TOURNAMENT PLAY 

If a competitor returns a score for any hole lower than actually taken due to failure to include a penalty stroke that the player did not know he had incurred, the player is not disqualified.  The penalty for the applicable Rule is applied, but there is no additional penalty.  

### DISTANCE MEASURING DEVICES

The local rule allowing distance measuring devices will be in effect for all league rounds. A player may obtain distance information by use of a distance measuring device. If, during a stipulated round, a player uses a distance-measuring device to gauge or measure other conditions that might affect his play (e.g. elevation changes, wind speed, etc.) the player is in breach of Rule 14-3, for which the general penalty applies for the first offense and disqualification for any subsequent offense.
